\abstract{
Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) reported the results of an experiment (N = 26 in the final sample) comparing the facial (surface) electromyographic correlates of mental rumination and distraction, following an experimentally induced stressor. Based on the absence of significant difference in the perioral muscular activity between the rumination and distraction conditions, Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) concluded that \emph{self-reported} inner experience was unrelated to peripheral muscular activity as assessed using surface electromyography. We suggest this conclusion is hasty and based on waggly evidence. Indeed, concluding on the absence of an effect based on a low-powered non-significant p-value is strongly problematic/uninformative. Moreover, the relation between self-reports and physiological measures was not \emph{directly} assessed, but only indirectly inferred from differences (or absence thereof) in group means. Given the ample inter-individual variability in these measures (as suggested by our reanalysis), we think inferring the individual-level relation between self-reports and physiological measures from group means is inappropriate. Given these limitations, we conclude that it is unclear whether the target article adds to the current/extent knowledge and we suggest ways forward, both from a theoretical and from a methodological perspective.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The activity of silently talking to oneself or ``inner speech'' is a foundational ability, allowing oneself to remember, plan self-motivate or self-regulate. Despite its multiple adaptive functions in everyday life, inner speech can go awry and leads to sustained negative\ldots{} These inner speech ``dysfunctions'' (for reviews, see Alderson-Day \& Fernyhough, \protect\hyperlink{ref-alderson-day_inner_2015}{2015}; Lœvenbruck et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-loevenbruck_cognitive_2018}{2018}; Perrone-Bertolotti et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-perrone-bertolotti_what_2014}{2014})\ldots{}

Given the predominantly verbal nature of rumination (e.g., Ehring \& Watkins, \protect\hyperlink{ref-ehring_repetitive_2008}{2008}; Goldwin et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-goldwin_concreteness_2013}{2013}; Goldwin \& Behar, \protect\hyperlink{ref-goldwin_concreteness_2012}{2012}; McLaughlin et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-mclaughlin_effects_2007}{2007}), we previously proposed to consider rumination as a form of inner speech and to study it using the methods that have been used historically to study other forms of inner speech, namely, by using surface electromyography and motor interference protocols (e.g., Nalborczyk et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017}{2017}; Nalborczyk, \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_understanding_2019}{2019}; Nalborczyk, Perrone-Bertolotti, et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_articulatory_2020}{2020}; Nalborczyk, Banjac, et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_dissociating_2020}{2020}). We first showed that induced rumination was accompanied by increased facial (both over a forehead and a perioral site) muscular activity in comparison to a rest period (Nalborczyk et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017}{2017}). However, because the rumination condition did not have a proper control condition in this first study, it was unclear whether this perioral activity were specifically related to (inner) speech processes. Therefore, we ran an extension of this study, in which we compared verbal to non-verbal rumination, which suggested that the facial EMG correlates we have previously identified were not specifically related to the verbal content of the ruminative thoughts (Nalborczyk, Banjac, et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_dissociating_2020}{2020}). We discussed these findings in length and proposed several theoretical interpretations that can account for these results in the discussion section of Nalborczyk, Banjac, et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_dissociating_2020}{2020}) and more extensively in Nalborczyk (\protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_understanding_2019}{2019}). Although these discussions were blatantly ignored by Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}), their experimental design nevertheless had the potential to inform our understanding of the involvement of the speech motor system in different varieties of inner speech as well as to clarify the relation between the peripheral correlates of inner speech and the (self-reported) subjective experience.

The main conclusion from Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) is that inner experience between induced rumination and distraction differs ``without a change in electromyographic correlates of inner speech''. In other words, they suggest that the subjective experience of inner speech is unrelated (or loosely related) to the electromyographic correlates of inner speech, which are thought to be represented mostly by the EMG amplitude recorded over the OOI and OOS muscles. However, for this in-sample observation to be of interest in an out-of-sample context (i.e., to be informative of other non-observed individuals, or said otherwise, to bring information about the population), this absence of difference has to be based on sufficiently powered sample size (given the target effect size) as well as on reliable measures. This is unlikely to be the case here, for reasons that we will present and discuss in the following. Moreover, a simple visual exploration of the data reveals important variability between individuals in the main effect of interest. That is, some participants had higher perioral (OOS and OOI) muscular activity in the rumination condition than in the distraction condition, and some other participants showed the reverse pattern. This suggests unexplored variation in the determinants of this effect (e.g., the content of the inner experience). Indeed, the relation between the inner experience and the physiological correlates of inner speech production was only inferred from group means. However, given the previous point, this appears highly problematic. We explore each of these limitations and suggests ways forward in the following section.

\section{Exploring the data}\label{exploring-the-data}}

Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) recorded\ldots{} in 26 participants (data available at \url{https://osf.io/hj7tz/})\ldots{} The EMG data is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:general} by condition (where \texttt{BAS}, \texttt{DIS}, and \texttt{RUM} refer to the baseline, distraction, and rumination conditions, respectively) and by muscle (\texttt{FRO}, \texttt{OOI}, \texttt{OOS}).

\caption{Average natural logarithm of the EMG peak amplitude per muscle and condition. The black dots and intervals represent the by-group average and 95\% confidence interval (N = 26). The horizontal white line in the violin plot represents the median. The grey dots represent the individual-level average natural logarithm of the EMG amplitude by muscle and condition.}\label{fig:general}
\end{figure}

We fitted a multivariate Bayesian regression model with varying-intercepts (by participant) and weakly informative priors on these data using the \texttt{brms} package (Bürkner, \protect\hyperlink{ref-R-brms}{2017})\ldots{}

Posterior distribution of the difference between the distraction and rumination conditions\ldots{}

A summary of the estimations from this model is presented in Table \ref{tab:summary}. For each muscle, the intercept gives the estimated of the natural logarithm of the EMG peak amplitude in the baseline condition, whereas the \texttt{conditionDIS} and \texttt{conditionRUM} parameters indicate deviations from the baseline in the distraction and rumination conditions (respectively).

\subsection{Concluding on the null from low-powered studies: what could go wrong?}\label{concluding-on-the-null-from-low-powered-studies-what-could-go-wrong}}

There is an infamous tradition of running uninformative null-hypothesis significance tests in Psychology (e.g., Meehl, \protect\hyperlink{ref-harlow_problem_1997}{1997}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-meehl_theoretical_1978}{1978}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-meehl_why_1990}{1990}\protect\hyperlink{ref-meehl_why_1990}{a}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-meehl_appraising_1990-1}{1990}\protect\hyperlink{ref-meehl_appraising_1990-1}{b}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-meehl_theory-testing_1967}{1967}). By ``uninformative'', we mean that some null-hypothesis significance tests are often \emph{not} diagnostic with regards to the substantive question of interest\ldots{}

As highlighted by many authors (e.g., Pollard \& Richardson, \protect\hyperlink{ref-pollard_probability_1987}{1987}; Rouder et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-rouder_is_2016}{2016}), concluding on an absence of difference based on not obtaining evidence for the difference is the continuous extension of the logical fallacy of the\ldots{} The argument from ignorance, such as ``Science has found no proof of intelligent life nearby us in space, therefore intelligent life does not exist nearby us in space.''\ldots{} the absence of evidence fallacy or fallacy of acceptance\ldots{}

This problem is tackled in modern usages of null-hypothesis significance test by ensuring that the test has good \emph{severity} (e.g., Mayo \& Spanos, \protect\hyperlink{ref-mayo_severe_2006}{2006}; Mayo, \protect\hyperlink{ref-mayo_statistical_2018}{2018}). In general terms, we have evidence for a claim to the extent that it survives a stringent scrutiny, that is if it survives \emph{severe tests}. In other words, some claim (e.g., \(\theta = 0\)) is said to be \emph{severely tested}) if it had great chances of being falsified, was the claim false. More formally, we can define \(\text{SEV}(T, x0, H)\), the severity with which claim \(H\) passes test \(T\) with outcome \(x0\), and \(\text{SEV}(\mu > \mu_{1}) = \Pr(d(X) \leq d(x0); \mu = \mu_{1})\) (Mayo, \protect\hyperlink{ref-mayo_statistical_2018}{2018}; Mayo \& Spanos, \protect\hyperlink{ref-mayo_severe_2006}{2006})\ldots To put it simply\ldots{} \url{https://www.analytics-toolkit.com/glossary/severity/}\ldots{}

Anticipating the critics on the power of their study (a critic that was probably raised during peer review), Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) report the results of a (possibly ran a posteriori) power analysis using the effect size reported in Nalborczyk et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017}{2017}) of \(d = 0.72\), which is highly optimistic estimate of the substantive effect of interest in the target article (i.e., the difference in EMG amplitude between the rumination and distraction conditions) as this effects represents the standardised mean difference \emph{between a rest period and a rumination one} (Nalborczyk et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_orofacial_2017}{2017})\ldots{}

We suggest the (a priori) power of the study ran by Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) was much lower than suggested by the authors. Indeed, we may speculate that the effect (i.e., the standardised mean difference in EMG amplitude) between the rumination and distraction conditions may be much weaker than the effect (i.e., the standardised mean difference in EMG amplitude) between the rumination and the rest conditions. If we assume that the former is half the size of the latter (which seems reasonable given the high inter-individual variability in such effects, cf.~the next section but also Nalborczyk, Grandchamp, et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_can_2020}{2020}), therefore the a priori power of the main statistical test from Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) was around \(0.44\), meaning that they had less than 1 chance out of 2 to find a significant effect, given that the effect in the population was actually \(0.36\). Because this is less than the chance of obtaining a head in a coin flip, we feel these resources may have been better invested.

Anticipating the legitimate critique that the absence of a significant difference is not \emph{necessarily} ``significant'' evidence for the absence of an effect, Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) reported the following Bayes factor (BF) analysis:

\begin{quote}
``{[}\ldots{]} therefore it is possible that the sample size of the present study lacked sufficient power to detect the effect of rumination on muscle activity. In order to test this, a Bayesian paired samples t-test was conducted for the peak log values of muscle activity between the rumination and distraction conditions. This revealed strong evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis for the FRO muscle (\(B_{10} = 18.79\)), and moderate evidence in favour of the null hypothesis for the OOS (\(B_{10} = 0.232\)) and OOI (\(B_{10} = 0.278\)) muscles, according to current guidelines for interpreting Bayes factors {[}43{]}.''
\end{quote}

While we appreciate the effort, the current approach poses new problems. First, contrary to what the authors suggest, computing a BF (i.e., comparing two models) does not solve \emph{at all} the problem of low power\ldots{}

We first fitted a multivariate Bayesian regression model with varying-intercepts (by participant) and weakly informative priors on these data using the \texttt{brms} package (Bürkner, \protect\hyperlink{ref-R-brms}{2017}). From there, we i) generated new datasets from the posterior predictive distribution and ii) we computed the BF in favour of the alternative hypothesis (\(\text{BF}_{10}\)) using the \texttt{BayesFactor} package (Morey \& Rouder, \protect\hyperlink{ref-R-BayesFactor}{2018}). We used a ``medium'' prior (i.e., a scale of 1) on the scale of the Cauchy prior for the alternative hypothesis. We repeated this procedure for varying sample sizes from 20 to 200 participants (by increments of 10 participants) with \(1000\) simulations (i.e., 1000 simulated datasets) for each sample size.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Average natural logarithm of the Bayes factor in favour of the alternative hypothesis, along with its standard error, computed over 1000 datasets of increasing size simulated from the posterior predictive distribution of the varying-intercept multivariate Bayesian regresion model. A log-BF belows 0 represents evidence for the null hypothesis (relative to the alternative) and a log-BF above 0 represents evidence for the alternative hypothesis (relative to the null).}\label{fig:simulated-power}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:simulated-power}, the natural logarithm of the BF in favour of the alternative hypothesis is growing proportionally with the sample size. More precisely, whereas low sample sizes (i.e., below 80) support the null hypothesis, adequately-powered sample sizes support the alternative hypothesis for all three facial muscles for sample sizes larger than 80 participants. For instance, the average \(\text{BF}_{10}\) computed for the OOI muscle with a sample size of 160 participants is of \(\exp(2.18) \approx 8.85\), indicating that these data are approximately \(8.85\) times more likely under the alternative hypothesis than under the null hypothesis.\footnote{Alternatively, the BF can be interpreted as an updating factor, from prior odds to posterior odds.}

We should keep in mind some limitations of this analysis, which uses simulated datasets form the posterior predictive distribution estimated on the data collected by Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}). This analysis is the loose Bayesian analogue of the frequentist post-hoc power analysis, which has been much criticised (e.g., Lakens, \protect\hyperlink{ref-lakens_20_2014}{2014}). Most importantly, an assumption of the present analysis is that the data from Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) is our best source of information regarding the main effect of interest (in addition to the prior we specified earlier). However, the present analysis also differs from the frequentist post-hoc power analysis on several grounds. First, with the present analysis, we do not aim to assess the ability of our statistical test to pass some dichotomic threshold (e.g., accept/reject). Instead, we aim to assess how the \(\text{BF}_{10}\) (i.e., the evidence for the alternative hypothesis, relative to the null hypothesis) behaves with varying sample sizes. Second, the present analysis relies on the posterior predictive distribution of the model fitted on the data from Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}), which naturally incorporates uncertainty about the effect of interest. By simulating datasets of varying sample sizes from the posterior predictive distribution (and by relying on a large number of simulations), uncertainty about the effect size is naturally incorporated into the simulation.

In Nalborczyk, Banjac, et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-nalborczyk_dissociating_2020}{2020}), we manipulated the modality of rumination (whether it is verbal or non-verbal) in a between-subject manner to avoid order effects\ldots{} In contrast to this approach, Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) asked participants to ruminate and then distract themselves (or reciprocally), after an induced stressor (an induced failure)\ldots{}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{Average log-EMG amplitude by muscle and condition. The black dots and intervals represent the by-group average and 95\% confidence interval (N = 26). The horizontal white line in the violin plot represents the median. The grey dots represent the individual-level average natural logarithm of the EMG amplitude by muscle and condition.}\label{fig:order}
\end{figure}

About the order effects, Moffatt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-moffatt_inner_2020}{2020}) say:

\begin{quote}
``Unless otherwise reported, the inclusion of order in which the conditions were completed as a between-subjects variable as part of a mixed-design ANOVA produced no significant main effects or interactions involving order.''
\end{quote}

Unfortunately, the same line of reasoning applies for testing the effect of the order, which is even less powered than the test of the main effect of interest, rendering it practically uninformative\ldots{}
