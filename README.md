## Abstract

Moffatt et al. (2020) reported the results of an experiment (N = 26 in the final sample) comparing the facial (surface) electromyographic correlates of mental rumination and distraction, following an experimentally induced stressor. Based on an absence of significant difference in the perioral EMG-amplitude between the rumination and distraction conditions, Moffatt et al. (2020) concluded that (the *self-reported*) inner experience was unrelated to peripheral muscular activity as assessed using surface electromyography. We suggest this conclusion is hasty and based on waggly evidence. Indeed, concluding on the absence of an effect based on a low-powered statistical test is strongly problematic/uninformative. Moreover, there relation between self-reports and physiological measures... Although the question Moffatt et al. (2020) pursued if of interest, and mehods... Given these limitations, it is unclear whether the target article really adds to the current knowledge.
